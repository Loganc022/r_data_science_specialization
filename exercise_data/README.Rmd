The code run_analysis.R does the following. 

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one tidy data set that is organized by activity and subject and that only includes the mean and standard deviation values
2) The feature names have been updated to be full word descriptions
3) The data set is organized by subject and activity
4) The final data set gives an average of each feature's mean and std for each subject and activity

In order to run the code dplyr must be loaded
